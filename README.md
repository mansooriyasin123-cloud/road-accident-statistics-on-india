🎯 SDG Goal:

SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities
(Focus: Enhancing Public Transport Systems)

This project supports SDG 11, which aims to make cities safer, more resilient, and sustainable. By studying road accident data, we can understand how public transport and private vehicle use impact safety, and how better urban transport planning can reduce accidents.

💡 Objective:

The main goal of this mini-project is to:

Analyze road accident trends across different Indian states.

Compare accidents involving public transport (like buses) and private vehicles (like cars and bikes).

Suggest how strengthening public transport systems can reduce overall accidents and create safer, sustainable cities.

🧮 Methodology:

A sample dataset of six major Indian states was created.

Data includes:

Total number of accidents per state.

Number of accidents involving public transport.

Number of accidents involving private vehicles.

The data was analyzed using Python (pandas + matplotlib) to visualize patterns.

📊 Graphical Explanation:
1️⃣ Bar Chart – Total Road Accidents by State

Shows which states have higher numbers of road accidents.

🔹 Insight: Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh record higher accident counts, suggesting dense traffic and higher vehicle ownership.

2️⃣ Stacked Bar Chart – Public vs. Private Transport Accidents

Compares how many accidents involve public and private vehicles in each state.

🔹 Insight:
Private vehicles cause a larger share of total accidents.
Encouraging people to use safe, reliable public transport can significantly reduce accidents.

3️⃣ Pie Chart – State-wise Share of Total Accidents

Displays each state’s contribution to national accident numbers.

🔹 Insight:
A few states contribute a major share to total accidents — focusing safety programs there could have a big impact.

🔍 Result and Analysis:

* There is a strong correlation between the number of private vehicles and total accidents.

* Public transport shows fewer accidents per vehicle, meaning it’s safer and more sustainable.

* Promoting public transport, better road infrastructure, and traffic education can reduce road fatalities and support SDG 11 goals.

🏁 Conclusion:

This project highlights how enhancing public transport systems can make cities safer and more sustainable.
By investing in buses, metros, and smart traffic systems, India can reduce road accidents, improve air quality, and create inclusive, sustainable urban mobility — in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11.
